            <p>Pelé aggravated a groin injury two games into the 1962 World Cup in Chile, sitting out the final rounds while Brazil went on to claim its second straight title. Four years later, in England, a series of brutal attacks by opposing defenders again forced him to the sidelines with leg injuries, and Brazil was bounced from the World Cup after one round.<br><br>

                Despite the disappointment on the world stage, the legend of Pelé continued to grow. In the late 1960s, the two factions in the Nigerian Civil War reportedly agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire so they could watch Pelé play in an exhibition game in Lagos.<br><br>
                
                The 1970 World Cup in Mexico marked a triumphant return to glory for Pelé and Brazil. Headlining a formidable squad, Pelé scored four goals in the tournament, including one in the final to give Brazil a 4-1 victory over Italy.Brazilian football (soccer) player Pelé is regarded as perhaps the greatest player in the history the game. In his time he was probably the most famous and possibly the best-paid athlete in the world. He was part of the Brazilian national teams that won three World Cup championships (1958, 1962, and 1970).</span><br><br>

In 2003 the Barcelona Football Club contracted the Brazilian super star for forty five million dollars. In 2004, Ronaldinho won the player of the year. I think he really deservered it. He scores a lot of goals and he's also a great penalty taker. He has a chance to be the best player in 2005. I hope he wins. He's the best soccer player ever.After playing for a minor league club at Bauru, São Paulo state, Pelé (whose nickname apparently is without significance) was rejected by major club teams in the city of São Paulo. In 1956, however, he joined the Santos Football Club, which, with Pelé at inside left forward, won nine São Paulo league championships and, in 1962 and 1963, both the Libertadores Cup and the Intercontinental Club Cup. Sometimes called “Pérola Negra” (“Black Pearl”), he became a Brazilian national hero. He combined kicking power and accuracy with a remarkable ability to anticipate other players’ moves. After the 1958 World Cup , Pelé was declared a national treasure by the Brazilian government in order to ward off large offers from European clubs and ensure that he would remain in Brazil. On November 20, 1969, in his 909th first-class match, he scored his 1,000th goal.[p097tyuiop[3ghyuir o32]t5yuiklp[3-5yitkp3[4-r9tuh ioer]-0yu89fe'[3]hkfl32049hyujkeptghuj fdle[-0r9gjklw]\er[bjkl;[wp0 tgujklwpituhjnkleopdgujklewpgiu jnrmepgiujfkwl;o9gui<br><br></span>
